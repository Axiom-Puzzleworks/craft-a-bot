- **thought** — It thought (1508 in, 133 out; tool_call; 20 s at the provider).
- **thought** — It decided: “I see the investigation confirms this is an authorised push-payment scam with a new payee, and the amount is 90157 which is above the 85000 limit.

- **did** — It did decide {"outcome":"refer","reasons":["app-above-limit"]}.
