- **thought** — It thought (1672 in, 155 out; tool_call; 22 s at the provider).
- **thought** — It decided: “I need to check the lending rules against the applicant's data. The score band is very-good (not poor), defaults are 0 (not 2+), and the ratio is 14% (not over 100%), so it's not a decline. For referral: score band is very-good (not fair), no defaults, no arrears, but there are 3 searches in 12 months which triggers referral. The ratio is 14% which is not over 60%. So the referral reason is the 3…” — verify-identity {}
- **did** — It did verify-identity {}.
  - On behalf of BambleweenyOne (service).
- **result** — The world answered: Identity was already verified.

- **thought** — It decided: “I need to explain the decision to the applicant. Based on the rules, the applicant has 3 credit searches in 12 months, which triggers a referral. The decision should be "refer" with the reason "searches" and "rules-cannot-decide". Let me explain this to the applicant.” — explain-decision {"reasons":["searches","rules-cannot-decide"],"text":"Your application has been referred to an underwriter because there have been 3 credit searches in the last 12 months.
